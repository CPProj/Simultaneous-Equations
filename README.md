# Simultaneous-Equations

This piece of code solves simultaneous equations. The number of variables are taken from the user. If solution is not possible it will print "MATH ERROR". 

# Input
Step 1: Enter the number of variables in the equations that is to be solved
Step 2: Enter the equations int the given format

# Working 
The given equations are solved using matrices
If the equations have no solution then it prints "MATH ERROR".

# Output
The equations are printed first followed by it's solution

# IDE Used
IDE used was TURBO C4
